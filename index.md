of charge_

The II edition of the Peptides in Biology and Materials: Bridging simulation and
Experimental Data workshop will take place from the 28th to the 30th of
April 2026, and will be hosted at the University of Sofia, Bulgaria.

The Peptides in Biology and Materials: Bridging Simulation and Experimental Data
workshop was first organized in 2024 as a [satellite to the European Peptide Symposium](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/peptides-in-biology-and-materials-bridging-simulation-and-experimental-data-1333).

Following the success of the first iteration, this edition focuses on
expanding ties to experimental research while promoting attendance by young
researchers.

We were able to leverage funding to cover the entirety of
participation costs, meaning [**attendance is free of charge**](/II/registration).

In a partnership with [Frontiers in Chemical Biology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemical-biology),
workshop participants are further invited to publish their results free of
charge in a [dedicated issue](about:blank).
