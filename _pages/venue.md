## Travel

There are several ways to travel to Sofia:

Standard carriers use Terminal 2, while low-cost companies may land either on Terminal 1 or Terminal 2. If you arrive on Terminal 1, there is a free shuttle bus to Terminal 2. There are also public busses or taxis which connect this terminal directly with the city center.
- __By bus__: A number of international bus lines operate between Bulgaria and other countries in the region. They arrive at the Serdica Bus Station. For particular lines and tickets availability you may check [Flixbus](https://global.flixbus.com/bus/sofia) or [Union Ivkoni](http://en.union-ivkoni.com/).
- __By train__: It is also possible to reach Sofia by train but the international destinations are rather limited: Bucharest or Craiova in Romania and Istanbul in Turkey. More info: [Office for international rail tickets](https://www.bdz.bg/en/a/office-for-international-rail-tickets).
- __By car__: Sofia is easily accessible by car. There are highways entering from the west, east or north. Just follow the standard instructions of your navigation system.
